                    Hi I'm Lewis, and I'm a web developer. My strengths are mainly in front-end with technologies such as React, although I am sufficient in some
                    backend technologies such as Node and Express. I'm currently looking for an opportunity to work in a company that will help me progress into
                    a career as a fullstack developer. If you would like to know more about my projects, please visit my github.
                </p>
